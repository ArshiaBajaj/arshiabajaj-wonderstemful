        <p>Hi everybody! I am excited to serve as the founder and president of WonderStemFulL. I am currently a Junior at South Forsyth High, where I am actively involved in various STEM organizations and projects, including coding, TSA, FBLA, and the Math Team. Through this organization, I aspire to create accessible education for all, especially underprivileged youth! Apart from this, a fun fact about me is that I once received a letter back from Barack Obama! I am so ready for the journey ahead! 🚀</p>
